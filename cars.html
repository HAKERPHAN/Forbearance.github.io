														Cars the thing which I love the most in this world. I dont know why but I am obessed with cars.<br><br><br><br>
														 As I said I'm crazy for I even learned how to drive a car at the age of 16 and drove my friends dad car.At that time I felt soo good that I cant even explain.Even though for other people it may be just a car with four wheels and an engine but it is not for me.<br><br>
														 It even got crazier when I got to know about Japanese cars , me the guy who loves Anime and now Japanese cars it was car .The Japanese cars are called JDM by the car community.There is this one Japanese car called TOYOTA SUPRA, for I am crazy it looks like normal car but after modification it goes to an unbelievable speed.People even say that it can beat a BUGATTI CHIRON but yeah obviously it is a mean.<br><br>
													
														 When I first said to my family that I can drive they were like they care much about it and it still does.I can talk whole about cars but people dont realize that how big the car community is. <br><br>
