													Everyone in their childhood might have thought why everything cant be free in this world,I also thought about that but it has more disadvantages than advantages<br><br>
													See if everything was free in this world than it would be nice and fun.
													People will not have to work there will be no poverty,everyone will have everything they want as everything is free but only for a certain time.<br><br>
													
													If everything was free in this world people would stop working as everything is free.If if people stop working then the world will get destroyed.As the farmers would stop working, there is will be shortage of food then electricity wont be provided as the electrician would working and managing the energy.Air pollution will increase everyone will  get a vehicle and more.<br><br>
													
													People would start fighting over things and everything would in demand as everyone needs in the world.Celebrities wont be celebrities anymore everyone would lead a life of luxury for a while until the world has food after that people will start eating people for their survival.<br><br>
													
													So those who think why world is not free these are the problems we have to face if the wrold is free.Here is your answer about how the world would end up if everything was free.
