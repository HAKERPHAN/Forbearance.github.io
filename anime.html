								Anime widely people call it cartoon but it is not cartoon. Anime is a japanese animation from manga.<br>
								Manga is a japanese comic and it is animated then it is called as Anime . <br>
								Anime is quite popular but somewhat underrated as people call it is cartoon.<br>
								 It is far different from cartoon ,if you have started watching anime it is super fun.<br>
								 but people don't realize until they start watching it. After like 10-15 anime there is litral competition between people that I have watched this anime you also try it is good.<br>
								 I have seen people that started watching anime from the big anime like Naruto,One piece,Bleach,jojo,etc.<br>
								 I recommend to watch small anime to get interest in it so that you watch more anime and enjoy the art form.<br><br>
								 
						Anime suggestion to start watching :
								 <br>
								 <br>
								
								<div class="anime-lists">
								 
							 <ul>
								<li> Death note (1 season - 37 episodes)</li><br>
						 <li> Demon slayer (2 season - 44 episodes)</li><br>
							<li>	 One punch man (2 season - 24 episodes)</li><br>
								<li> Parasyte (1 season - 24 episodes)</li><br>
								<li> Dr.stone (2 season - 35 episodes)</li><br>
								<li> Darwin's game (1 season - 12 episodes)</li><br>
								<li> Jujustu kaisen (1 season - 24 episodes)</li><br>
								<li> The promised neverland (2 season - 24 episodes)</li><br>
								 </ul>  <br><br>  </div>
								<div class="anime-main-blog-1">  
								  These are some animes to watch.After watching these you can go for bigger anime to watch. I would suggest to watch Naruto and then One piece, One piece is bigger than Naruto.<br>
								 Some people might say that One piece is better than Naruto but according to me they both are good in their own way.<br>
								 Naruto is based on ninja's and One piece is based on pirates. Now we cant compare pirate and ninjas.<br>
